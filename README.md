# Flask Boilerplate
### _Flask boilerplate inspired by The Flask Mega-Tutorial by Miguel Grinberg_

![License](http://img.shields.io/:license-mit-blue.svg)

When i started learning Flask, I found a lot of boilerplates on the web. However, I decided to create mine as i was learning, in order to have a clean custom base for future projects.
Special thanks to Miguel Grinberg for his amazing tutorial, and Max Halford for the inspiration of doing my own boilerplate.

## Features

- [x] User account sign up, sign in, password reset, all through asynchronous email confirmation.
- [x] Form generation.
- [x] Error handling.
- [x] HTML macros and layout file.
- [x] "Functional" file structure.
- [x] Python 3.x compliant.
- [x] Asynchronous AJAX calls.
- [x] Administration panel.
- [ ] Static file bundling, automatic SCSS to CSS conversion and automatic minifying.
- [ ] Websockets (for example for live chatting)
- [x] Virtual environment example.
- [x] Digital Ocean deployment example.
- [ ] Tests.
- [x] Logging.
- [ ] Language selection.
- [ ] Automatic API views.
- [ ] API key generator.

I am open to any suggestions or help, don't hesitate to contact me at <pdamoune@gmail.com> or create an issue.

## Libraries

### Backend

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), obviously.
- [Flask-Login](https://flask-login.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for the user accounts.
- [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/) interacting with the database.
- [Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and [WTForms](https://wtforms.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for the form handling.
- [Flask-Mail](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Mail/) for sending mails.
- [itsdangerous](http://pythonhosted.org/itsdangerous/) for generating random tokens for the confirmation emails.
- [Flask-Bcrypt](https://flask-bcrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for generating secret user passwords.
- [Flask-Admin](https://flask-admin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for building an administration interface.
- [Flask-Script](https://flask-script.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for managing the app.
- [structlog](http://structlog.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for logging.
- [Flask-DebugToolBar](https://flask-debugtoolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for adding a performance toolbar in development.
- [gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) for acting as a reverse-proxy for Nginx.

### Frontend

- [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) for the global style. Very similar to [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
- [Leaflet JS](http://leafletjs.com/) for the map. I only added it for the sake of the example.

## Structure

I did what most people recommend for the application's structure. Basically, everything is contained in the `app/` folder.

- There you have the classic `static/` and `templates/` folders. The `templates/` folder contains macros, error views and a common layout.
- I added a `views/` folder to separate the user and the website logic, which could be extended to the the admin views.
- The same goes for the `forms/` folder, as the project grows it will be useful to split the WTForms code into separate files.
- The `models.py` script contains the SQLAlchemy code, for the while it only contains the logic for a `users` table.
- The `toolbox/` folder is a personal choice, in it I keep all the other code the application will need.
- Management commands should be included in `manage.py`. Enter `python manage.py -?` to get a list of existing commands.
- I added a Makefile for setup tasks, it can be quite useful once a project grows.


## Setup

### Vanilla

- Install the requirements and setup the development environment.

	`make install && make dev`

- Create the database.

	`python manage.py initdb`

- Run the application.

	`python manage.py runserver`

- Navigate to `localhost:5000`.


### Virtual environment

``
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
venv/bin/activate (venv\scripts\activate on Windows)
make install
make dev
python manage.py initdb
python manage.py runserver
``


## Deployment

The current application can be deployed with Docker [in a few commands](https://realpython.com/blog/python/dockerizing-flask-with-compose-and-machine-from-localhost-to-the-cloud/).

```sh
cd ~/path/to/application/
docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-memory 512 --virtualbox-cpu-count 1 dev
docker-machine env dev
eval "$(docker-machine env dev)"
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose run web make dev
docker-compose run web python3 manage.py initdb
```

Then access the IP address given by `docker-machine ip dev` et voil√†. This is exactly how [OpenBikes's API is being deployed](https://github.com/OpenBikes/api.openbikes.co).


## Configuration

The goal is to keep most of the application's configuration in a single file called `config.py`. I added a `config_dev.py` and a `config_prod.py` who inherit from `config_common.py`. The trick is to symlink either of these to `config.py`. This is done in by running `make dev` or `make prod`.

I have included a working Gmail account to confirm user email addresses and reset user passwords, although in production you should't include the file if you push to GitHub because people can see it. The same goes for API keys, you should keep them secret. You can read more about secret configuration files [here](https://exploreflask.com/configuration.html).

Read [this](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/config/) for information on the possible configuration options.
